Rackspace Colocation Customer Guide
===================================

*Last updated:* |today|

Rackspace Technology Colocation allows you to secure the infrastructure you
own within Rackspace Technologyâ„¢ data centers. This eliminates the costs
associated with operating and managing a data center of your own
and brings hardware within reach of global multi-cloud networks. These services
are available in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa (EMEA),
Asia Pacific, and Japan (APJ). Customers retain management of their hardware,
but we offer Smart Hands as a complimentary service that provides
colocation customers access to a highly trained team of technicians and
engineers available 24x7x365 for routine physical tasks.
