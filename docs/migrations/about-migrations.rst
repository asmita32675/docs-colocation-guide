Rackspace Colocation migration phases
-------------------------------------

This section outlines the systematic approach Rackspace Technology uses to
expertly plan and execute a migration of your hardware to our facility.

**Migration phases**:

  - **Pre-engagement:** Successful migration projects begin with outlining the
    project scope. At the kick-off meeting, Rackspace Technology migration
    experts work with you to clarify the best-fit platform for your needs and
    review cost structures. With your input, we develop and approve the project
    objectives, budget, and timeline.

  - **Assessment:** The second phase includes assessing and analyzing your
    current environment and rationalizing the environment with your
    future-state cloud strategy. The goal is to ensure that the decisions made
    today align with your future requirements.

  - **Design:** During this phase, Rackspace Technology profiles all of the
    applications and hardware in scope and customizes a migration strategy
    based on your future-state cloud architecture.

-   **Plan:** Rackspace Technology schedules your hardware migration around your
    business operations, details your move requirements, schedules your hardware
    move, and documents post-move test plans and go-live processes.

  - **Build:** Rackspace Technology assigns your colocation elements, such as
    cabinets and cages, and builds out any infrastructure required, such as
    cross-connects and PDUs, in anticipation of the hardware move from your data
    center or a third-party or Rackspace Technology data center.

  - **Migrate:** For the physical move, Rackspace Technology partners with a leading
    freight and logistics company with vast experience in hardware migration
    services. Rackspace Technology validates the inventory pre-move, tracks
    progress during the move, and helps ensure that all of your hardware arrives
    at its destination on time. After it arrives, you can
    deploy your hardware yourself or have Rackspace Technology do the
    unpacking, racking, and cabling for you.

  - **Handoff and close:** Rackspace Technology validates that the move and set-up
    complete successfully and that your new environment is up and running.
