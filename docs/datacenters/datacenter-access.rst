To provide customers a Fanatical Experience®, we provide every
Rackspace customer with a dedicated implementation leader to guide you through the
implementation process. The implementation leader contacts you directly and
lets you know when the colocation environment is ready to accommodate your
deployment. Together, you establish a move-in date for your colocation
deployment, and the implementation leader serves as the primary liaison between
you and the data center operations team.
