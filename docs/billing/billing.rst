Billing

Rackspace Colocation uses an allocated billing model, which charges by the
kilowatt (kW), for the right to use a defined amount of reserved redundant
critical power. There is no additional charge for space or cooling. A customer
may request an additional standard rack-sized equivalent space for every 4kW
reserved.  Customers also pay monthly recurring fees for cross-connects and
blended bandwidth if purchased.

Rackspace bills customers for one-time installation fees, power circuits, private cages,
in rack-PDUs, and cross-connects.
