Hardware Installation
=====================

The customer coordinates deliveries with Rackspace Inventory and handles
receiving, unpacking, and moving their equipment into the DC
(see **Shipping, Receiving, and Inventory Services**) unless they pay for *Smart
Hands* for installation as part of their initial contract. The customer must secure
and get DC Facilty Engineering approval for any vendor or customer-supplied cabinets
to be installed.

During the customer installation, Rackspace provides contact information for
an onsite POC to answer questions and provide guidance and technical assistance
as needed. The customer should submit a Smart Hands request for any necessary
assistance with the installation of customer gear.
